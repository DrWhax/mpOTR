I am aiming to create an mpOTR plugin for various IM's like irssi and pidgin.

There have been several research papers to see how such a system will work, 
I aim to research these papers first, create my own paper, let it get peer- 
reviewed, renew the paper, build software as PoC, let it get peer reviewed,
make first beta, first plugin, peer review etc etc

TODO:
	* Research mpOTR paper, do we have any remarks to improve or adjust?
	* Create our own research paper which can be reviewed by the community.
	* After the review, 'Hack' multi-party support into 'libotr'.
	* Create plugins for irssi/pidgin/Adium
	* Debug time! * ...
	* Profit \o/
